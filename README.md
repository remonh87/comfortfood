# Comfortfood same app
Sample project that shows possibilities of Flutter embedding into an existing Android app. 
For now it show the following:
* Embedding a sample Flutter module into an existing Android project
* Using a warmed up Flutter Engine
* Sending data through method channels

I am planning to add more advanced usecases to this repo in the future.

## Get started
Run the main app module.

Besides master I kept two other branches open that shows step by step how to do specific integrations.
